								<h3>Modality invariant representation for efficient robot task learning (Master’s thesis research)</h3>
								<p>The aim of the research is to discover an unsupervised representation learning method for multimodal data (e.g. visual, depth, tactile, proprioception, etc.) that is scalable and can be used in different domains. The advantages of the researched method would be that (1) the trained model can produce higher quality embeddings when trained with multiple modalities w.r.t. to just training with one modality and (2) has intrinsic robustness against missing modalities after training phase thanks to its architecture.</p>
								<p>The researched method could be used for example in robot control tasks (e.g. stacking objects, in-hand manipulation, etc.) by using Inverse Reinforcement Learning or in object/pose/task classification.</p>

								<h2>Past Projects</h2>
								<h3>Visual Task Progress Estimation with Appearance Invariant Embeddings for Robot Control and Planning</h3>
								<p>This work was achieved when I was at Preferred Networks as Research Intern in 2019. We developed a representation method for task progress estimation. The method uses the consistency of the progress among different examples and viewpoints of a task to train a deep neural network to map images into measurable features.

								<h3>Vessel Remote Control System development</h3>
								<p>I was one of the main developers of the ABB Marine & Port's ship Remote Control Systems (RCS) in the R&D department. The new revision I was working on introduced new bridge devices using CANopen and UDP communication protocols and new bridge control logic for three ABB Azipod (propulsion unit) control systems. The programming languages I used were mainly CODESYS for ABB’s AC500 Programming Logic Controller (PLC) and C# based language for ABB’s AC800M PLC and ABB’s Panel Builder HMI application. Besides the control logic for the bridge’s propulsion control, I also created the communication interfaces for integrating the new devices to the existing control system.</p>

									<h3>Robot Sushi Restaurant (School project)</h3>
								</div>
								<p>Robot Sushi Restaurant is an automated conveyer belt sushi restaurant, also known as "Kaiten Sushi" in Japan. The project was done in collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimmo-mikkanen-23037514a/">Kimmo Mikkanen</a> and its goal was to create an automated conveyer belt sushi restaurant with products' quality and freshness in mind. Our Kaiten Sushi's special feature is our designed "Freshness System" to monitor the freshness of each individual product and dispose them when their serving time has passed.</p>
								<p>My part on the project was mainly creating the communication & control logic for the Freshness System (RFID-tags & antennas, IR-sensors and an actuated dish remover) and help with creating the user interface on the chef's panel and customer's panel. All the programming was done by Omron’s Sysmac Studio and user interface with Omron's CX-Designer.</p>
								<p>This work was done while at National Insitute of Technology Sendai College as exchange student between 2016-2017</p>
